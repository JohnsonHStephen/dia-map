        <p><strong>VOLCANIC EVENT</strong>: Journeying near an active volcano is, of course, not safe in any circumstances, and even less so given the churning activity of a typical Avernian caldera. There are several volcanic events that could arise as an oppressive condition.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>choking miasma</strong> of volcanic gas (see Oppressive Environment, above). More serious outbreaks of volcanic gas are also possible; resolve as a <em>cloudkill</em></li>
            <li>An <strong>active lava flow</strong>, blocking the desired path of travel.</li>
            <li>A <strong>tephra fall</strong>, in which multiple inches and even several feet of ash can fall as precipitation. Add +2 to the DC of navigation checks and +4 to the DC of forage checks.</li>
            <li>A <strong>lahar</strong>, a violent mudflow formed from a slurry of pyroclastic material. (Resolve like an avalanche.)</li>
            <li>An <strong>eruption</strong>. This might be modeled by requiring the PCs to flee the hex within a certain timeframe.</li>
        </ul>
