        <li>On the Styx</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feonar has a supply of <strong>Phlegethosian sand</strong> which is useful for her necromantic work.</p>
        <p>Feonor is in a relationship with Carol D'Vown (Hex D2). She previously was in a relationship with Mahadi, but fell in love with D'Vown when she met her at the Wandering Emporium. There is a 1 in 4 chance that D'vown and her gang of infernal constructs are visiting Feonor here.</p>
        <p><strong>The Amphibious Warlord</strong>: Feonor has a number of amphibious infernal machines, including some which can operate on both water and land. Her lair is built around a cavern located along the Styx.</p>
        <p><strong>Ossuary Arsenal</strong>: Lady Bladeharrow is an undead devil forgemaster created by Feonor herself. She is described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/294349/Forges-of-Avernus?affiliate_id=81207"><em>Forges of Avernus</em></a>, p. 4.</p>
        <blockquote><p><em>Design Note: As described in Forges of Avernus, Lady Bladeharrow has a “mobile forge” called the Ossuary. We are removing the mobile concept and ensconcing her in Feonor's Lair. Remember that soul coins can be used to create undead, so Feonor is likely to have a substantial cache of them.</em></p></blockquote>
