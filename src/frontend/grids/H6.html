        </strong></big></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Visible 2 (volcano) / Hidden (outpost, see below)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clinging to the inside wall of a volcano’s caldera is a modron outpost. A huge geothermal spike thrusts down into the volcano below, powering a clockwork menagerie of technomantic marvels within the outpost. Upon occasion, the outpost extends an astral antenna above the rim of the volcano to take readings and also broadcast transplanar reports. The antenna can also provide access to the outpost.</p>
        <p>(When this antenna is raised, it can be visible to a great distance. The outpost should otherwise be considered a Hidden location.)</p>
        <p>The modrons use this outpost to monitor the Blood War. Its presence is known to the local Blood Legions and tolerated: partly because they’ve learned that if they destroy these monitoring outposts, the modrons just build more; partly because the modrons have also been known to trade valuable technomantic items upon occasion.</p>
        <p>The modrons have a supply of <strong>Nivanan cogboxes</strong>.</p>
