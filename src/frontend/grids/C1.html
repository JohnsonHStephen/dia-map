        <p>Through the mouth of a colossal dragon's skull, a tunnel passes back to Tiamat's Lair. The tunnel is really more of a highway. (The size of the dragon skull really cannot be overstated.) Arkhan the Cruel and his followers are currently in a camp just down the hill from the dragon skull.</p>
        <p><strong>Tiamat's Lair</strong>: The mountain is a prison, although Tiamat has successfully tested the limits of that prison many times. Her lair is like an onion, with layers upon layers of caverns always worming their way deeper and deeper towards her five lairs (and many false lairs). Some of these tunnels actually ooze across planar boundaries. In one place, for example, her lair is connected or consanguineous with the Dragonspawn Pits of Azharul (another draconic deity whom Tiamat destroyed and subsumed a century ago).</p>
        <p>The highway leads to the outer fortifications of Tiamat's lair, which stand guard upon the Gate Tower of Dis. This fluted tower stands in the middle of a truly mammoth cavern, surrounded by temporary merchant camps and stockyard-type infrastructure. The tower actually pierces through the planar boundaries between the layers of Hell. Inside the tower, a huge ramp leads down for a seemingly absurd distance (it takes several hours to descend) before emerging out of a tower on the outskirts of Dis, the infernal city which is the second layer of Hell.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the lair, atop the mountain peaks, are five towers - one for each of Tiamat's chromatic heads - which rear up into the sky in a crown-shaped redoubt. These towers serve as entrances for draconic followers of Tiamat.</p>
