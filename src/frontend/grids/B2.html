        <li>On River</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are charonadaemon ferry stations on both shores of the Styx here. There are commissions available for travel up- and downriver, but most regular travel simply crosses the river to the other station.</p>
        <p><strong>Sudok's Mart</strong>: The station on the contra-Dis side of the river is larger and contains a small market overseen by a yugoloth named Sudok.</p>

        <li>On Bridge (Across Pit of Shummrath)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Alvskraema caravanserai is located next to the bridge which crosses the Pit of Shummrath. It is jointly operated by Brarumoch, Haskari, and Meltrus.</p>
        <p><strong>Brarumoch</strong>: Operates the common room and runs the kitchen. The caravanserai's specialty is elf meat. Brarumoch has a supplier who hunts and butchers elves on the Material Plane; here they are considered an expensive delicacy known as <em>alvskraema</em>.</p>
        <p>(This doesn't mean that any elf walking through the door will be set upon and butchered. That's not the sort of thing you do to a customer.)</p>
        <p><strong>Haskari</strong>: Operates a weapons forge. He specializes in creating cacophonous weapons, which allow those wielding them to speak and understand Abyssal. (See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/294349/Forges-of-Avernus?affiliate_id=81207"><em>Forges of Avernus</em></a>.)</p>
        <p><strong>Meltrus</strong>: Specializes in repairing and building infernal machines. He and Haskari are constantly squabbling over shop space.</p>
