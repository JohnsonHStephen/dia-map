        <p>These ruins were once the sanctum of the Queen of Lilies, who ruled over a verdant paradise before it was swept away by the sands of Avernus.</p>
        <blockquote><p><em>Design Note: As written, the Queen of Lilies was an ancient Archduchess of Avernus. You might position her as having served in the armies of Ashmedai (i.e., Asmodeus) when he conquered the plane. Alternatively, with even greater revision, the Queen of Lilies might have ruled here BEFORE the Fall of Avernus and the paradise described here is what Avernus was like prior to the events of the Averniad.</em></p></blockquote>
