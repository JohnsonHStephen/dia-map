<p>This is the lair of the warlord Algoran and his gang, the Soul Collectors.</p>
<p><strong>Shrine to Eskarna</strong>: Algoran discovered an ancient shrine dedicated to the demon Eskarna. It was built
    countless aeons ago at a time during which the demons had pushed the front lines of the Blood War deep into Avernus.
    Long abandoned and forgotten, it was discovered by Algoran and converted into a gladiatorial arena.</p>
<p><strong>Gladiatorial Arena</strong>: Watched over by the well-worn statue of Eskarna, Algoran hosts gladiatorial
    competitions here which attract a varied crowd of visitors and competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Cogbox</strong>: Algoran recently acquired a modron slave as a wager during the gladiatorial fights. The
    modron has a <strong>Nirvanan cogbox</strong>. The modron might be willing to trade it for anyone who can help them
    gain their freedom; alternatively, if Algoran learns its value, he will seize it and try to make a deal (or wager)
    himself.</p>
<p><strong>Shaaksuraar's Armory</strong>: A “mountain of a sahuagin-werebear” called Shaaksuraar oversees a productive
    weapons forge for Algoran. This is located in the river cavern; Shaaksuraar goes on swims through the subterranean
    river and also quenches his fresh-forged weapons in the waters here. See <a target="_blank"

    <p><em>Design Note: The concept of Eskarna comes <a target="_blank"
                href="https://dysonlogos.blog/2020/11/09/shrine-of-the-demon-eskarna/">from Dyson's original key</a> for
            this map, although we have reduced it to an ancient ruin here. In Forges of Avernus, Shaaksuraar manages the
            Goregut Armory, but the Goreguts' lair (Hex J3) in the Remix has been destroyed by Princeps Kovik (Hex J5).
            I've reassigned Shaaksuraar to Algoran, but you could also make this part of his backstory: That he worked
            for Raggadragga until his forge was destroyed by Kovik. (To add extra drama, perhaps Shaaksuraar betrayed
            Raggadragga to Kovik for a large payment of soul coins before transferring his services to his new forge
            here.)</em></p>
