<p>Respen Shadowswimmer escaped Plagueshield Point (Hex G5b) shortly after it was sucked into Hell and eventually found
    his way to this abandoned tower, which he has made his own. An arcane researcher, he is fascinated by the properties
    of the Styx and has been researching its long-term effects on various creatures. Most recently this has resulted in
    the creation Stygian behemoths.</p>
<p>Respen Shadowswimmer used a <strong>heartstone</strong> during his research at Plagueshield Point, but wasn't able to
    bring it along. He'd dearly prize a replacement, as he thinks it would prove invaluable in continuing his research
    here.</p>
