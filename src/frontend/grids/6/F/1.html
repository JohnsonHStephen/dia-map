<p>This stronghold carved into the side of the mountain was once the lair of the warlord Jevvka of Osternia. Her gang
    crossed the Powers That Be in Avernus and a cohort of the Blood Legions sacked the compound, leaving it in ruins.
    Jevvka herself was crucified to the back wall. Her corpse hangs there still, along with a warning painted in her own
    blood:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>WITNESS THE WRATH OF BEL. LET IT STAND AS WARNING TO THOSE WHO DOUBT HIS POWER.</p>
</blockquote>
