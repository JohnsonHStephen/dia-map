        <p>Uldrak was the son of Gond. The interior of his helmet has been transformed into a tinker’s shop, serving as a pit stop for infernal machines that need cheap repairs. Among his supplies are a set of <strong>astral pistons</strong>.</p>
        <p>There’s a 1 in 6 chance that 1d4 riders from a warlord’s band are here getting their machines checked out. If so, there is an additional 1 in 6 chance that the warlord themself is present.</p>
