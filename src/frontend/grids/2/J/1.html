<p>Kostchtchie is more than willing to team up against Zariel if freed. What form that assistance takes will depend a
    lot on the plan the PCs propose (don't feel bound by the adventure's script here).</p>
<p>As described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/293787/Dance-of-the-Deathless-Frost?affiliate_id=81207"><em>Dance of
            Deathless Frost</em></a>, the demon cannot be permanently killed unless <strong>Kostchtchie's
        phylactery</strong> is destroyed. This is why Zariel has imprisoned Kostchtchie instead of killing him. PCs who
    obtain the phylactery (see the Witch-Queen's Abode, Hex B3) would have something of value to Zarielâ€¦ and even
    greater value to Kostchtchie.</p>
