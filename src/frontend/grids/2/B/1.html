    <li>On River</li>
</ul>
<p>There are charonadaemon ferry stations on both shores of the Styx here. There are commissions available for travel
    up- and downriver, but most regular travel simply crosses the river to the other station.</p>
<p><strong>Sudok's Mart</strong>: The station on the contra-Dis side of the river is larger and contains a small market
    overseen by a yugoloth named Sudok.</p>
