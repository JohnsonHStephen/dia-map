<p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>THE SHUMMRATH DAM</strong></big></p>
<br />
<p>A huge dam has been erected at one end of the Pit of Shummrath, preventing the ooze from flowing out into the Styx.
    (Stygian waters are periodically let into the Pit through a similar dam at the other end.) Sometimes the dam leaks
    and sometimes it overflows; the river canyons beyond this dam are thus lined with a sickly sludge made up Stygian
    water and Shummrathian ooze, leading to strange mutations amongst the flora and fauna.</p>
