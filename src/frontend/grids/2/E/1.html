<p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>E2. TENTACULAR MINE<br />
        </strong></big></p>
<p>A huge, open pit surrounded by fields of reddish slag is ringed with colossal, writhing tentacles.</p>
<p>The pit is a mine for green Baatorian steel. The tentacles are the groping extremities of a carcinomatous baatorian
    buried here. Its squirming extremities pose a constant danger to the miners.</p>
<p><strong>Baatorian Steel</strong>: Baatorian steel can only be mined on Avernus, and its supply is often limited due
    to the logistical difficulties created by the Blood War. A piercing or slashing weapon crafted from Baatorian steel
    deals +1 damage and has a +1 bonus to attack rolls. (This is not a magical enhancement and does not stack with
    magical bonuses.)</p>
<p>Green baatorian steel is even rarer. It has the same properties, but can also be more easily crafted into <em>swords
        of wounding</em> (and so most green Baatorian steel blades are such).</p>
<p><strong>Baatorian Dream Machine</strong>: In the depths of the mine there is a technomantic device, built on somewhat
    similar principles to Mad Maggie's dream machine, which keeps the cancroid baatorian dormant in a slumbering dream.
    Its effective range is limited, however, which is why the tentacles are most active (and dangerous) at the surface.
</p>
<p>The machine includes a <strong>Nirvanan cogbox</strong>. If the cogbox is removed (or the machine otherwise
    disabled), however, the baatorian will awake and rip the mine apart.</p>
