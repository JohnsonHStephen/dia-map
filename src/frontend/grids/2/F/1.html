<p><strong>Baron Barur Tolmanen</strong>: The Lord of the Purple City served with Zariel in the Rift War. In addition to
    telling the tales of the Rift War often during his disturbing, gluttonous feasts, various memorials around the city
    glorify the events of the Rift War (and Tolmanen's role in it).</p>
<p><strong>The March</strong>: Lux Arakxis, the leader of this criminal organization, has been obsessed with finding the
    Sword of Zariel, mounting numerous expeditions to little effect over the years. He knows the Sword was lost after
    the Charge of the Hellriders, and he will wax rhapsodic about the tale of their ride into Hell (recounting the
    identities of the Three Generals and events following the kidnapping of Yael, who he's certain took the Sword from
    the final battleâ€¦ although his personal theory is that she stole it and betrayed Zariel.)</p>
<p>The March also uses <strong>heartstones</strong> for planning their heists.</p>
<p><strong>Archmagi of Thraxai</strong>: Agamemnova Hex, the leader of the Archmagi of Thraxai, once met Lulu while Lulu
    was imprisoned in the Wandering Emporium.</p>
