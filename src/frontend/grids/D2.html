        <li>On the Styx</li>
        </ul>
        <p>D'vown has a <strong>Heartstone</strong>, which she uses in her alchemical experiments.</p>
        <p>Carol's tower squats on the banks of the Styx near where a tributary from the Pit of Shummrath joins the river. She takes samples from the Styx, the Pit, and the effluvium mixture of the two and experiments to see what alchemical “delights” she can discover from them.</p>
        <p>Carol is in a relationship with Feonor (Hex I2), having met her at Mahadi's Wandering Emporium years ago. There is a 1 in 6 chance that Feonor and 1d4-1 members of her gang are visiting Carol here.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>D2b. THE SHUMMRATH DAM<br />
        </strong></big></p>
        <p>A huge dam has been erected at one end of the Pit of Shummrath, preventing the ooze from flowing out into the Styx. (Stygian waters are periodically let into the Pit through a similar dam at the other end.) Sometimes the dam leaks and sometimes it overflows; the river canyons beyond this dam are thus lined with a sickly sludge made up Stygian water and Shummrathian ooze, leading to strange mutations amongst the flora and fauna.</p>
