    <li>On the Styx (under the river)</li>
</ul>
<p>A drow citadel which was built around a magical geode (which now serves as a demonic prison) and was sucked into
    Hell, where it fell to the bottom of the Styx.</p>
<p>Commander Ljubomir, who now oversees the tower, is enjoying considerable prestige from the bargain he wrought which
    resulted in the tower's capture. As it's a recent acquisition, its function as a secure holding facility for demons
    near the front lines of the Blood War is only just being spun up.</p>
<p><strong>Geode Prison</strong>: The large geode at the heart of Plagueshield Point contains multitudes. It's not
    exactly larger on the inside than the outside. Rather, every version of its “inside” is out of phase with the others
    and can be accessed only one at a time. (However, gazing through different facets of the geode reveals the others.)

<p><strong>Demonologist's Tower</strong>: When Respen (see Shadowswimmer Tower, Hex I6) worked here, he used a
    <strong>heartstone</strong> in his research and it can still be found here.</p>
