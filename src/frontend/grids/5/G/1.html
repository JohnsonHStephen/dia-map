<p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>ZARIEL'S BRIDGE</strong></big></p>
<br />
<p>A bridge spans the Styx here, guarded on each end by a Styx Watchtower (DIA, p. 124). The original bridge which stood
    here was destroyed during the Rift War and the new bridge was dedicated to Zariel's glorious victory and ascension
    to Archduchess. Bas reliefs along the bridge depict various incidents from Zariel's life, accompanied by infernal
    inscriptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Averniad</strong>: Zariel is depicted (anachronistically in her fiendish form) in the midst of a lush,
        verdant paradise. (Inscription: “She served in the armies of the Lord of the Nine in the younger days, when
        Avernus had not yet become the Ninth.”)</li>
    <li><strong>Zariel &amp; Lulu</strong>: Zariel (anachronistically in her fiendish form) is depicted with Lulu, Yael,
        Haruman, and five devils. Their names are listed in Infernal cartouches (the otherwise unknown devil's names
        being given as Zilannen, Tozromon, Brullmerath, Xilka, and Venthroxoth). (Inscription: “In memory of her
        comrades lost over the long eons of struggle.”)</li>
    <li><strong>Zariel's Fall</strong>: Zariel is depicted kneeling before Asmodeus, her wings aflame as her
        “impurities” are burnt away. (Inscription: “At the feet of the Archfiend her heart was opened to the truth, and
        she ascended to the ranks of the esteemed.”)</li>
    <li><strong>Zariel's Imprisonment</strong>: Zariel is depicted in chains. Above her are the five heads of Tiamat.
        (Inscription: “At the false word of the coward Bel, she was sealed in the prisons of the Progenitor.”
        <em>Note</em>: <em>One of Tiamat's titles is the Progenitor of Hell</em>.)</li>
    <li><strong>Second Avernian March</strong>: Zariel is on the front lines of a titanic battle between devils and
        strange creatures which seem neither demon nor devil. A DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the
        creatures as baatorians. (Inscription: “In glory did she triumph where false Bel failed, in the name of the Lord
        of Nessus.”)</li>
    <li><strong>Zariel Becomes Archduchess</strong>: Zariel is crowned by Asmodeus. (“All hail the Archduchess of
        Avernus, may she rule eternal at the left hand of the Archfiend.”)</li>
