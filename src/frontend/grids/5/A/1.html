<p>This is the lair of Kolasiah, the Infernal Medusa, and the Lost Golgari, who have come to Avernus from Ravnica.
    Kolasiah seeks a way of returning home and would value any news of a powerful spellcaster not allied with Zariel.

<p><strong>Entrance Ramp</strong>: Infernal war machines come roaring down the ramp and are parked in a cluster around
    the central stone pillar.</p>
<p><strong>Forge</strong>: In the central pillar of the rock at the bottom of the entrance ramp there is a forge and
    garage run by Malargan the Oni. See <a target="_blank"

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Design Note: As written in </em>Warlords of Avernus<em>, the Lost Golgari have been reduced to a fraction of
            their former strength. You can either lean into that (with chunks of their base here being deserted) or I
            would potentially go the other way and bolster her to have a larger number of infernal machines and
            riders.</em></p>
