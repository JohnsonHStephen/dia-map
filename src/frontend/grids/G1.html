        <p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>G1. ADJUNCT COURT OF HELL<br />
        </strong></big></p>
        <p>A tall, perfectly square tower filled with a Kafka-esque bureaucracy. Although lower staff members are devils of various sorts, the judges and upper management are Rilmani – perfect embodiments of neutrality who oversee and resolve disputes over infernal contracts.</p>
        <p>These courts operate under the authority of Primus, as established in the Trial of Asmodeus. (The history of the Trial, along with “fun” facts like Zariel’s small part in that ancient history, can likely be established if anyone asks questions.)</p>
        <p>Research at the court can also provide useful information about how infernal contracts (like the contract Zariel uses to hold Elturel in Avernus) can be broken. PCs might think to litigate the Elturian contract, but that probably won’t pan out unless the PCs go to truly extraordinary efforts of deception (which will almost certainly earn them the eternal enmity of the forces of neutrality if it is ever discovered): the contract is, legally speaking, impregnable.</p>
