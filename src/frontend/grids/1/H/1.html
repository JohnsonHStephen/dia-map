<p>The Dump was once the Void Chateau, a strange house in Waterdeep owned by a mage known as Chalice Void. The chateau
    eventually vanished from Waterdeep and reappeared in various towns along the Sword Coast, before settling once more
    on a hill outside of the village of Amphail. One morning there was a terrible howling sound and the chateau vanished
    from the Material Plane forever.</p>
<p>It had somehow become embedded in the banks of the River Styx. It now serves as a munitions dump, supplying materiel
    to the frontlines of the Blood War.</p>
<p>The Dump contains an <strong>unkeyed keystone</strong> to the Arches of Ulloch (hex A4), which can be rekeyed with
    only 10 soul coins of raw materials.</p>
