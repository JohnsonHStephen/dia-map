<p>These mines of adamantine and orichalcum are worked by still-living mortals who have been captured by devil
    slave-gangs or who have been bound to service through ill-conceived bargains. Caravans drag the raw ore to the
    Purple City (Hex F2), from whence it is shipped downriver to Bel's Forge (Hex H2) to be made into weapons for the
    front lines of the Blood War.</p>
