<p><strong>The Lost Hellrider</strong>: Beneath Weatherstone Keep is an ancient, heretical Temple of Torm. After the
    defeat of the Zarielites during the Charge of the Hellriders, one of the fleeing Hellriders reached this Keep and,
    following the divine guidance of Torm, sought refuge in the temple. The Hellrider was placed into a state of
    suspended animation and remains there still, protected by Torm's holy ground.</p>
