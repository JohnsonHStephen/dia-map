<p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>J1. SIEGEWORKS OF DIS<br />
        </strong></big></p>
<p>A tower of reddish, Avernian stone thrusts into the sky near a gaping black maw tunneled into the side of an obsidian
    peak.</p>
<p><strong>Abandoned Tower</strong>: The tower was once barracks and armory for hundreds of Blood Legion troops, with
    half-finished construction suggesting it was destined to house thousands more. But the tower stands unfinished and
    empty today, its strategic purpose lost with the end of the Reckoning and the abandonment of the mineworks.</p>
<p><strong>Mineworks</strong>: The tunnel is artificial, having been carved into the mountain. The work was begun during
    the Reckoning, when Zariel was laying siege to Dis. Stymied by the defenses of Dis, Zariel had the idea to create a
    second passage between the first and second levels of Hell.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the shaft is an infernal drill that, in that bygone era, might have been able to pierce the planar
    boundaries and undermine Dis. With the end of the war, the drill was abandoned and has long since decayed to
    uselessness. However, <strong>astral pistons</strong> were used in its construction and can be salvaged.</p>
<p><strong>Hellwasp Nests</strong>: The tunnel struck a number of natural caves and other cavities. Hellwasps have
    established a hive in one of these.</p>

    <p><em>Note: You could fill this dungeon with any number of cross-chambers filled with various denizens or Avernian
            wildlife (or even stranger stuff). Particularly relevant would be anyone seeking to hide from Avernian
            authorities. (Perhaps there's a force of inbred demons who got stuck behind the lines when the Blood War
            moved Abyss-ward. Or even Baatorians who escaped Zariel's wrath at the end of the Rift War.) Some of these
            inhabitants could have blocked the main passage, forcing the PCs to either excavate or find a route around
            the blockage.</em></p>
