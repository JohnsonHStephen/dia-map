<p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>A1. AVERNIAN TARPIT<br />
        </strong></big></p>
<p>A vast tarpit several hundred feet across. The is hot enough to burn (1d6 fire damage) and it is constantly bubbling.
    Dangers include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A large gas bubble explodes, spattering those within 10 feet with hot tar. DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or 1d6
        fire damage.</li>
    <li>Getting stuck in the tar. (It counts as difficult terrain and requires a DC 14 Strength check to pass safely or
        a DC 18 Strength check to escape once stuck. If stuck, the victim will slowly sink into the tar, becoming
        submerged 3d6 rounds later.)</li>
    <li>Jets of flame spontaneously erupt from particularly strong outgassing.</li>
    <li>The gas itself can be toxic, requiring a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, characters are affected
        as per a <em>confusion</em> spell, rolling on the custom table below once per minute to determine their actions.
        At the end of each minute, they can attempt another saving throw.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several small outcroppings of rock and solid-ish land dotted throughout the tarpit. On one of these is a
    giant boulder of gold that gleams in the strange, reddish light of Avernus. (The boulder is actually pyrite; fool's
    gold.)</p>
