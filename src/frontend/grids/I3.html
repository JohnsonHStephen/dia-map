        <p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>I3. CIRCLE OF FLAMES<br />
        </strong></big></p>
        <p>This site resembles a druidic stone circle (like Stonehenge), but the sarsens are formed from plasmic masses of flame. Half sunken into the acidic muck (much of it polluted run-off from Belâ€™s Forge, Hex H2), several of the flame-sarsens gutter and flicker like torches on the verge of being blown out.</p>
