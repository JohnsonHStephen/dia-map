        </strong></big></p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Descent Into Avernus</em>, p. 98.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A set of <strong>astral pistons</strong> within the obelisk are intrinsic to Ubbalux' prison. The pistons can only be accessed if Ubbalux is freed.</p>
        <p><strong>FREEING UBBALUX</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>As described in <em>Descent Into Avernus</em>, Ubbalux has heard of the Mirror of Mephistar (Hex I1) and believes Mephistopheles can unravel the riddle.</li>
        <li>Bel built the prison and could free him. Ubbalux can also point them towards Bel's Forge (Hex H2). (If it seems reasonable, Ubbalux might still be under the impression that Bel is the Archduke of Hell.)</li>
        <li>You can also solve Bel's original “riddle” (see below).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>INVESTIGATING THE STONES</strong>: Bel told Ubbalux that the secret to escaping the prison was hidden in the arcane runes etched across the standing stones. The trick is that crucial information is located on the outside of the stones, where Ubbalux can't see it.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check indicates that each of the outer standing stones is associated with one of the schools of magic.</li>
        <li>A character who speaks Infernal or succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check will notice that each standing stone has a cartouche containing two syllables, one of which is either the first or second syllable of the associated school of magic in Infernal and the other appears to be a nonsense syllable.</li>
        <li>A similar cartouche appear on the inside of the stone (where Ubbalux can see it, although you can also look across the circle and see them from outside) with a similar pairing of the first or second syllable of the associated school of magic in Infernal (whichever one isn't on the outside) and a nonsense syllable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>SOLVING THE RIDDLE</strong>: Combining the two “nonsense” syllables on each stone forms a command word associated with that stone. You can intuit the correct order of the syllables by looking at the matched syllable from the school of magic. (So the syllable in the cartouche with the first syllable of the school of magic should be the first syllable of the command word and the second syllable should be the second.)</p>
        <p>To release Ubbalux, you need to place your hand on each stone and speak the associated command word (suffering the effect described on pg. 98 of <em>Decent Into Avernus</em>). Once this has been done with all eight stones, the energy field drops: Ubbalux is freed and the central obelisk can be accessed.</p>
