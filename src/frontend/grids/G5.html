        <p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>G5a. ZARIEL&#8217;S BRIDGE<br />
        </strong></big></p>
        <p>A bridge spans the Styx here, guarded on each end by a Styx Watchtower (DIA, p. 124). The original bridge which stood here was destroyed during the Rift War and the new bridge was dedicated to Zariel’s glorious victory and ascension to Archduchess. Bas reliefs along the bridge depict various incidents from Zariel’s life, accompanied by infernal inscriptions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Averniad</strong>: Zariel is depicted (anachronistically in her fiendish form) in the midst of a lush, verdant paradise. (Inscription: “She served in the armies of the Lord of the Nine in the younger days, when Avernus had not yet become the Ninth.”)</li>
        <li><strong>Zariel &amp; Lulu</strong>: Zariel (anachronistically in her fiendish form) is depicted with Lulu, Yael, Haruman, and five devils. Their names are listed in Infernal cartouches (the otherwise unknown devil’s names being given as Zilannen, Tozromon, Brullmerath, Xilka, and Venthroxoth). (Inscription: “In memory of her comrades lost over the long eons of struggle.”)</li>
        <li><strong>Zariel’s Fall</strong>: Zariel is depicted kneeling before Asmodeus, her wings aflame as her “impurities” are burnt away. (Inscription: “At the feet of the Archfiend her heart was opened to the truth, and she ascended to the ranks of the esteemed.”)</li>
        <li><strong>Zariel’s Imprisonment</strong>: Zariel is depicted in chains. Above her are the five heads of Tiamat. (Inscription: “At the false word of the coward Bel, she was sealed in the prisons of the Progenitor.” <em>Note</em>: <em>One of Tiamat’s titles is the Progenitor of Hell</em>.)</li>
        <li><strong>Second Avernian March</strong>: Zariel is on the front lines of a titanic battle between devils and strange creatures which seem neither demon nor devil. A DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes the creatures as baatorians. (Inscription: “In glory did she triumph where false Bel failed, in the name of the Lord of Nessus.”)</li>
        <li><strong>Zariel Becomes Archduchess</strong>: Zariel is crowned by Asmodeus. (“All hail the Archduchess of Avernus, may she rule eternal at the left hand of the Archfiend.”)</li>
        </ul>

        <li><em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dmsguild.com/product/291677/DDAL0907-The-Diabolical-Dive?affiliate_id=81207">The Diabolical Dive</a></em></li>
        <li>On the Styx (under the river)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A drow citadel which was built around a magical geode (which now serves as a demonic prison) and was sucked into Hell, where it fell to the bottom of the Styx.</p>
        <p>Commander Ljubomir, who now oversees the tower, is enjoying considerable prestige from the bargain he wrought which resulted in the tower’s capture. As it’s a recent acquisition, its function as a secure holding facility for demons near the front lines of the Blood War is only just being spun up.</p>
        <p><strong>Geode Prison</strong>: The large geode at the heart of Plagueshield Point contains multitudes. It’s not exactly larger on the inside than the outside. Rather, every version of its “inside” is out of phase with the others and can be accessed only one at a time. (However, gazing through different facets of the geode reveals the others.)</p>
        <p><strong>Demonologist’s Tower</strong>: When Respen (see Shadowswimmer Tower, Hex I6) worked here, he used a <strong>heartstone</strong> in his research and it can still be found here.</p>
