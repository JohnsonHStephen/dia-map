<p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>CIRCLE OF FLAMES</strong></big></p>
<br />
<p>This site resembles a druidic stone circle (like Stonehenge), but the sarsens are formed from plasmic masses of
    flame. Half sunken into the acidic muck (much of it polluted run-off from Bel's Forge, Hex H2), several of the
    flame-sarsens gutter and flicker like torches on the verge of being blown out.</p>
