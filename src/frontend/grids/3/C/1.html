<p>There are a dozen iron cages suspended over the edge of the Pit of Shummrath and designed to dunk their occupants
    into the demonic goo. When the PCs first arrive here, one of them is occupied by Baazit (DIA, p. 100). On future
    visits, there is a 1 in 4 chance of a new prisoner (which can be generated using the wandering encounter tables for
    Avernus).</p>
