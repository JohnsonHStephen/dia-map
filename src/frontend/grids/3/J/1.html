<p>Raggadragga and his gang got into a war with Princeps Kovik and the 8<sup>th</sup> Remnant (Hex J5), which the
    Goreguts decisively lost. Raggadragga and a ragged band of survivors managed to escape, but their lair was ravaged
    by Kovik.</p>
<p><strong>Inverted Crucifixes</strong>: Kovik took the dead and nailed them to inverted crucifixes in the former
    courtyard. Words blasted into the stone wall here read, “Damned be those who challenge Princeps Kovik of the
    8<sup>th</sup>.” There are three dead wereboars and five dead wererats.</p>
<p><strong>Ruined War Machines</strong>: Three burned out husks of what were once infernal war machines are just outside
    the walls.</p>
<p>Raggadragga has several potential scenario hooks related to these recent events:</p>
<ul>
    <li>He's actively seeking anyone with resources or skills who might help him rebuild the lair.</li>
    <li>He's also looking for alternative locations for a lair (including the possibility of seizing one).</li>
    <li>He would also like to return to the lair long enough to bury his dead.</li>
    <li>He'd like to stage a raid on the 8<sup>th</sup> Remnant's lair (Hex J5) to steal back the infernal war machines
        they took from him.</li>
</ul>

    <p><em>Design Note: As you're working up the key for this location, think about dropping clues pointing to both its
            original owners (the Goreguts) and its destroyer (Princeps Kovik).</em></p>
