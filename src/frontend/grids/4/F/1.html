        </strong></big></p>
<ul>
    <li>Visible</li>
    <li><em>Descent Into Avernus</em>, p. 134</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several important changes to this location:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The citadel cannot be seen; it is completely subsumed by the Cyst.</li>
    <li>No one knows that this is where the Sword of Zariel lies hidden. As noted previously, this secret is held only
        in Lulu's lost memories.</li>
    <li>Therefore, there are no devils or demons here excavating the site. (You could have them here just harvesting the
        bloody pulp of the cyst for one reason or another, but you'd want to make significant changes to the key.)</li>
    <li>Yael's ghost does not give the PCs' visions of Idyllglen. (They already experienced those in the Dream Machine.)
        See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://thealexandrian.net/?p=46059">Part 6D-L</a> for
        what happens when the PCs encounter her.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Design Note: As mentioned previously, the goal is for the PCs to recognize the Bloody Cyst so that the moment
            that it's revealed as the hiding place of the Sword of Zariel it's a cool revelation and not a, “Wait?
            Where?” moment. (It's okay if they need to follow up on their vision; lots of people in this area of Avernus
            know the location of the Bloody Cyst and can direct them - it's just not ideal.)</em></p>
    <p><em>It's positioned in Hex F4 because (a) characters crossing the bridge in Hex G5a will likely run into it and
            (b) this also makes it a convenient landmark for NPCs to use while giving directions.</em></p>
    <p><em>One of my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://patreon.com/justinalexander">patrons</a>
            also recommended that Mahadi's Emporium could be camped out at the base of the Bloody Cyst at some
            point.</em></p>
