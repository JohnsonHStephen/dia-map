<p>There is a 1 in 4 chance that the tower is present (check per day if the PCs camp out at the site).</p>
<p>If the tower is not present, the iron foundations should be considered a <strong>Hidden</strong> location unless the
    PCs are specifically traveling along the edge of the lake or on the island itself. Spotting the foundations from the
    shores of the lake requires a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>Mordenkainen can provide a <strong>Heartstone</strong> or <strong>Phlegethosian sand</strong>. His asking price for
    either is 30 soul coins, unless the PCs have done him some form of great service (like saving his life from an
    assassin).</p>
<p><strong>Assassination/Kidnapping</strong>: Why not both? The assembled devils include both those secretly plotting to
    assassinate Mordenkainen and those who will kidnap the PCs if that seems advantageous.</p>
<p><strong>Tower Maps</strong>: Ideally, we would also like to prep maps of Mordenkainen's tower. <a target="_blank"
