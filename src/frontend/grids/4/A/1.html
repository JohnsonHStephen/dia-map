</ul>
<p>The Arches of Ulloch allow the mass transport of entire armies, but they require the use of a <strong>tuned
        keystone</strong> (similar to the planar tuning fork required for a <em>plane shift</em> spell) to align them
    with a particular plane of existence.</p>
<p>One of the arches currently has an ancient <strong>Avernian keystone</strong>, allowing teleportation to anywhere
    within Avernus.</p>
<p>Creating a new tuned keystone requires:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Either the original plans (located in Bel's Fortress, Hex H2) or a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to reverse
        engineer the existing keystone.</li>
    <li>50 soul coins worth of raw materials.</li>
    <li>An appropriate workshop (such as those located in Bel's Fortress, Fort Knucklebones, or other Warlord armories).
    </li>
</ul>
