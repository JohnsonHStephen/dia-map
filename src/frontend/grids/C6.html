        <p>A narrow crack in the rock leads to a stone stair leading deep into the earth. At the heart of this shrine is a small, verdant patch of the glorious paradise which Avernus once was. Just fifty feet across, this patch of the Avernus That Was has been preserved for eons.</p>
        <p>Lore of the Averniad is preserved here, speaking of how the forces of many different planes sought to claim Avernus for themselves; and of Asmodeusâ€™ betrayal that led to Avernus becoming aligned with Hell.</p>
        <p>This place is anathema to those with fiendish blood, who simply cannot enter (as if presented with an impenetrable invisible wall upon the threshold). Full fiends cannot even perceive the place unless forced to do so (for example, if they see someone else passing within).</p>
