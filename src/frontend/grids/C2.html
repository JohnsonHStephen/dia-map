        </strong></big></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Visible 1 (Visible 2 on a clear day, as per a mountain)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A terrifying tower of demon skulls, stacked more than a mile high. These are trophy-skulls claimed during the Blood War and placed in this monument during the time when the frontlines were located along the River Styx.</p>
        <p><strong>The Rift Mound</strong>: Near the base of the Pillar of Skulls is a second mound, reaching perhaps fifty feet high. These skulls were piled here during the Rift War. Inspection will reveal that they are not demonic (they are actually baatorian, although a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check is necessary to recognize that).</p>
        <p>On an obsidian sarsen at the base of the mound are carved the following words in Infernal:</p>
        <blockquote><p>FORGET NOT THE GLORIES OF THE BATTLE OF LOST MEMORIES. SEE BEFORE YOU THE ENEMIES OF HELL AND REMEMBER THEIR FOLLY. WE HONOR FOREVER THE DEEDS OF ZARIEL, SHE WHO ROSE BY HER BLADE. SHE WHO TRIUMPHED IN THE RIFT WAR. SHE WHO IS NEW-CROWNED ARCHDUCHESS OF AVERNUS.</p></blockquote>
