    <p>This is the DM's map for running the Avernian hexcrawl. It's designed for use with the Alexandrian Hexcrawl, as
        described in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46020/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl"><em>5E Hexcrawl</em></a>
        series. We'll be making some tweaks to this structure, however, to accommodate the unusual features of Avernus.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>HEX SCALE<br />
            </strong></big></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">1 Hex = 40 miles (center to center / side to side) = 23 mile sides = 1385 square
        miles</p>
    <p>The Avernian Hexcrawl uses 40 mile hexes. When tracking progress, this means it requires 20 miles of progress to
        exit a hex through one of the two nearest faces. (If they exit back through the face through which they entered
        the hex for a reason other than doubling back along their own trail, it requires 2d10 miles of progress to exit
        the hex, unless circumstances suggest some other figure.)</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><em>Design Note: The primary reason for choosing a 40 mile scale is because the PCs
                are likely to end up using infernal machines with much higher speeds of travel. The secondary reason is
                aesthetic: Avernus is supposed to be a wasteland. By increasing the scale of the hexes, we achieve that
                (increasing the average distance between points of interest).</em></p>

                        A grand canyon more than a mile deep and filled with a lake of green slime that undulates as though breathing. The slime is actually the protoplasmic residue of an ancient devil imprisoned here by Archduke Bel many centuries ago, still possessed of some residual sentience and a telepathic ability to communicate (see p. 100 of <em>Descent Into Avernus</em>).

In cracked regions of the wastelands, the land is riven with fissures and ravines. Navigating these regions is difficult, either requiring great effort to circle around impassable chasms, or maze-like passages through the fissures themselves.

    <p><strong>COMPASS DIRECTIONS</strong>: Cardinal and ordinal directions don't exist in Avernus. (There is no rising
        sun, no stars in a night sky, and no magnetic field for aligning compasses.) This imposes disadvantage to
        navigation checks until a navigator has adapted to the oddities of Avernian geography (by successfully reaching
        an intended destination for the first time).</p>
    <p><strong>PLANAR COMPASS</strong>: A <em>planar compass </em>is a technomantic device which allows for navigation
        in the Outer Planes. A <em>planar compass</em> aligns to the nearest planar borders. In this particular region
        of Avernus that corresponds to the planar borders with Dis (to the “north” side of our map) and the Abyss (to
        the “east”). Thus Dis-ward, Abyss-ward, contra-Dis, and contra-Abyss.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Design Note: For simplicity, you might still want to use the familiar cardinal directions at the table.
                Here's one way you could justify that: The word “north” actually derives from a word meaning “left”
                because it was the direction to the left of the rising sun. You could hypothesize an Avernian dialect in
                which the direction towards the Abyss (and the front lines of the Blood War) is adversa, and “Avernian
                north” is the direction to the left of that. In translation to the Common tongue, the common names -
                north, east, south, west - are extrapolated accordingly.</em></p>

    <p><strong>SIGHTING MOUNTAINS</strong>: In the absence of stars, sun, or magnetic fields, navigation in Avernus
        relies heavily on landmarks. In this particular region of Avernus, this is greatly aided by the Dispatrian
        Mountains that lie Dis-ward and the Praefervian Mountains to the contra-Dis.</p>
    <p>On a clear day, both mountain ranges can be seen at a distance of two hexes (80 miles), but will frequently only
        be visible from 1 hex away. The thick haze of the Avernian atmosphere, however, usually reduces this to a single
        hex. Volcanic peaks indicated on the map (like Bel's Forge in Hex H2) can similarly be seen at a distance of 1-2
        hexes.</p>
    <p><strong>IDENTIFYING MAP LOCATIONS</strong>: If the PCs make inquiries, assume that Avernian natives can identify
        1d6-1 locations on the player's map.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><big><strong>OTHER AVERNIAN GUIDELINES<br />
            </strong></big></p>
    <p><strong>FORAGING</strong>: Food and water - particularly that suitable for mortal consumption - is hard to come
        by in Avernus. The native flora and fauna have a bitter or ashen flavor, and even drinkable water usually tastes
        foul.</p>
    <p>Mortals make forage checks in Avernus at disadvantage. (Hell is not a place for mortals.) This does not apply to
        characters with demonic or devilish heritage (such as tieflings), who will find a broader range of Avernian
        wildlife suitable for their palates.</p>
    <p><strong>SPOTTING DISTANCE</strong>: Avernus is flat, which means there's no horizon to block vision. With a clear
        line of sight you could hypothetically see an infinite distance… if it wasn't for the atmosphere. On a perfectly
        clear day on Earth you can see about 150 miles through the atmosphere, but such conditions are rare on Earth and
        virtually impossible in Avernus.</p>
    <p>Assume a 1 in 6 chance of a clear day.</p>
    <p>On a <strong>typical day</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A character taking the Sighting watch action can see their current hex.</li>
        <li>Mountains can be seen 1 hex away.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On a <strong>clear day</strong> (by Avernian standards):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A character taking the Sighting watch action can see 1 hex (40 miles) away.</li>
        <li>Mountains can be seen 2 hexes away.</li>
        <li>Encounter spot distances in plains- or desert-type terrain (ashlands, wastelands, volcanic plains) are
            doubled. (Emphasize the disorienting nature of seeing creatures at such great distances to those
            unaccustomed to planar travel.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>UNSUITABLE TERRAIN</strong>: Land vehicles perform poorly in unsuitable terrain. Infernal war machines
        are well-suited to the Avernian wastelands, however, and are likely to only find mountainous terrain unsuitable.
        At the DM's discretion they might also find unusual terrain like the Pit of Shummrath or the caustic bogs
        similarly problematic.</p>
